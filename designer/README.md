# Impetus Impresario Designer

The Impetus Impresario Designer provides a cross-platform, user-friendly environment for creating and managing Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Decision Model and Notation (DMN) models. Itâ€™s designed to facilitate the design and understanding of complex business processes and decisions, directly supporting development within the Impetus Impresario ecosystem.

## Overview

The II Designer allows users to visually design and edit BPMN 2.0 and DMN 1.2 models.  Models created in the Designer can be seamlessly integrated with the II Engine for execution and monitoring.

## Key Features

- **BPMN 2.0 Support:**  Create and manage BPMN models, including activities, events, gateways, and sequences flows.
- **DMN 1.2 Support:** Manage DMN decision tables, including decisions, rules, and constraints.
- **Model Validation:** Built-in validation checks to ensure model integrity and compliance with OMG standards.
- **Interactive Editing:**  Easily modify models through a drag-and-drop interface.
- **Model Export:** Export models in various formats (e.g., BPMN 2.0 XML, DMN XML).
- **Version Control:** Model versioning to track changes and revert to previous states.
